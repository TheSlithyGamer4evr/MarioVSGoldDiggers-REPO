This is the repository for the Mario Vs Gold Diggers joke game.

This uses very specific versions of Haxeflixel because I was too lazy to update a lot of this stuff.

(heads up, a lot of this code kinda sucks so if anyone wants to fix it they can, this project was mainly made just for fun)
# INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPILING
First you're going to want the 4.2.5 version of Haxe 

The version I used was [4.2.5](https://haxe.org/download/list/)

These are very similar to the FNF build instructions so it won't be that hard if you have experience.

However I made an easier way to do this by making a setup batch file. The instructions are listed below

1. Download the source code

2. Run the "Dependencies Setup.bat" file

3. The compiling commands are the same as before
- `lime test windows` for windows

- `lime test linux` for linux

- `lime test macos` for macos

- `lime test hl` for fast compiling thanks to hashlink

- You can use `-debug` at the end of it to put the game into debug mode

- You can use `-DNO_WAVES` at the end (even with debug) to put playstate into a debug offset/test mode

# THAT'S IT
That's all you need to compile MVGD. Have fun with whatever unholy monstrosities you make with the source code!
