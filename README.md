This is the repository for the Mario Vs Gold Diggers joke game.
This uses very specific versions of Haxeflixel because I was too lazy to update a lot of this stuff.

(heads up, a lot of this code kinda sucks so if anyone wants to fix it they can, this project was mainly made just for fun)
# INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPILING
First you're going to want the most up-to-date version of Haxe 

The version I used was [4.2.5](https://haxe.org/download/list/)

Once you installed that you're going to want to copy and paste these in your command line.

These are very similar to the FNF build instructions so it won't be that hard if you have experience.

1. Install [HaxeFlixel](https://haxeflixel.com/documentation/install-haxeflixel/)
2. Download [Git-SCM](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
3. COPY AND PASTE THESE LINES INTO YOUR COMMAND PROMPT
```
haxelib set flixel 4.11.0
haxelib set lime 7.9.0
haxelib set openfl 9.1.0
haxelib set flixel-addons 2.11.0
haxelib set flixel-tools 1.5.1
```
the lines above are the versions I used for this project, send a message in the issues tab if there's a version i need to add to the list

4. Download hashlink, simply go into command prompt and type in `lime test hl` and follow the instructions from there

    or just go [here](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/hashlink/releases) if you're having trouble.
     I think the version I use is probably 1.11, not sure tho.

6. The compiling commands are the same as before
- `lime test windows` for windows

- `lime test linux` for linux

- `lime test macos` for macos

- `lime test hl` for fast compiling thanks to hashlink

- You can use `-debug` at the end of it to put the game into debug mode

- You can use `-DNOWAVES` at the end (even with debug) to put playstate into a debug offset/test mode

# THAT'S IT
That's all you need to compile MVGD. Have fun with whatever unholy monstrosities you make with the source code!
